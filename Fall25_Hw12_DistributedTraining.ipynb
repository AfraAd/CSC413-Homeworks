        "\n",
        "In Section 1, we build a `DistributedContext` class, which coordinates communication across multiple processes (e.g., training steps running on different GPUs). This simulates the role of a real distributed backend such as torch.distributed. However, to keep the assignment lightweight, our setting uses Python threads on a single CPU as though they were running on separate devices.\n",

For this assignment, we return to the simple MLP model we worked with earlier in the semester so that the focus remains on understanding the communication patterns rather than model complexity."

        "For tensor parallelism, you need tensor-parallel–specific layers to perform both column-parallel and row-parallel tensor sharding. The advantage of this approach is improved memory efficiency: each process only stores a slice of the full weight matrix instead of the entire layer. As a result, each process also stores proportionally smaller input cache and gradients. However, this comes at the cost of additional communication, since processes must exchange partial results during both the forward and backward passes.\n",

        "Both layers inherit from the shared TensorParallelLinear base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **ColumnParallelLinear**: A child class of TensorParallelLinear. It splits the full linear layer’s weight matrix along its column dimension, and each process holds a subset of the output features. During the forward pass, each process computes its partial output, and then performs a collective communication step (all-gather) so that the full output tensor becomes globally available.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **RowParallelLinear**:  A child class of TensorParallelLinear. It splits the weight matrix along its row dimension, and each process holds only the rows relevant to its shard of the input features. Each process computes a partial output from its local rows, and these partial outputs are then combined across processes using an all-reduce so that the full output is reconstructed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the input and output partitions differ across these two sharding schemes, they each require their own specialized *forward()* method. In addition, they need customized *backward()* logic: while gradients w.r.t the sharded weights can be computed locally without communication, gradients w.r.t. the input require an additional communication (e.g., all-reduce for column-parallel layers or all-gather for row-parallel layers). Again, we avoid using autograd and do it the manual way in this assignment."
