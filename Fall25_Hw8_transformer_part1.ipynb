        "In this homework, you will train a multi-label text classifier on a subset of [AG News](https://huggingface.co/datasets/r-three/ag_news_subset) dataset using a pre-trained BERT model. The AG News dataset consists of news articles categorized into one of four topics (0 - World, 1 - Sports, 2 - Business, 3 - Sci/Tech).\n",
        "\n",
        "**In part 1**, you will fine-tune a BERT-style model on the AG News dataset and evaluate its performance. You can find a tutorial for loading BERT and fine-tuning [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training). For simplicity, I recommend using the [Hugging Face Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index).You're welcome to use a different framework if you prefer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In part 2**, instead of fine-tuning a BERT-style model directly, you will use the representations from the BERT-style model as input to a linear classifier. Does this approach perform better or worse?\n",
        "\n",
        "For both part 1 and part 2, your goal is to achieve a test accuracy above the specified thresholds. You won’t have access to the test labels—just like in real-world applications!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tips about fine-tuning**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Data preprocessing: raw text data should be tokenized before being fed to the model as batches during trainig.\n",
        "* Hyperparameter choices: Experiment with settings such as learning rate, warmup ratio, optimizer, number of training steps, and batch size.\n",
        "* Avoid overfitting: remember that your fine-tuned model will be evaluated on the test set!\n",

        "**!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!**\n",
        "\n",
        "You are free to explore and implement the training code however you want to maximize the model performance. However, please put the code you're running under `if __name__ == '__main__':` so that the particular training step is not run when we later evaluate your final script! Otherwise you may fail the Markus tests due to timeout.\n",
