        "Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) compress knowledge from vast amounts of text, but in practice they often need additional fine-tuning to perform well on specific downstream tasks. Fine-tuning can be done by updating all of a model’s parameters (full-model fine-tuning) or by modifying only a small subset, a strategy known as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which is typically preferred for its computational and memory savings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular option for PEFT, because it introduces small trainable matrices (A and B) that adjust a model’s generation without altering most existing parameters. In this homework, we will fine-tune a pretrained LLM, HuggingFace’s SmolLM2, on a downstream dataset using both full-model training and LoRA. After evaluating the full-model version in Part 1, we will implement our own LoRA-based fine-tuning in Part 2. For more background on LoRA, you may find it helpful to review the original paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685\n",

During instruction fine-tuning, it is common to apply a template to the dataset to format inputs and outputs into a consistent conversational structure that the model can learn from. This templated dataset is then used to fine-tune the LLM.\n",

        "The base-model is trained to predict the next token and may not inherently understand what a “user message” or an “assistant response” is. Templates impose a conversation structure to the text, from whcih the model is trained to predict when the assistant's turn is and what style of output to produce. For instance:\n",

        "We will fine-tune the model on the *everydata-conversation* split of the SmolTalk dataset, which contains multi-turn conversations between a user and an assistant across a wide range of topics (sports, fashion, health, entertainment, and more). After fine-tuning, you will see how even a simple instruction-tuning approach can significantly improve generation quality."
